To ensure a class has a single instance:
- restricts the instantiation of a class to only one object.
- ensures that only one instance of the class can be created, and provides a global point of access to that instance.


Singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a private constructor,
which prevents other objects from creating instances of the class.
