provides an interface for creating objects in a super class,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Factory pattern is useful when you have a hierarchy of classes that need to be created,
but the specific type of object to be created is not known until runtime.
By using a Factory, you can create objects dynamically, based on the context in which they are needed.
