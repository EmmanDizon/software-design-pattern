In Command Design Pattern, requests or operations are wrapped inside objects known as Command objects.
Each Command object represents a single request or operation, and it contains all the information needed to execute the request.

 The request information is encapsulated in the Command object, including the method name,
 the object that the method will be called on, and any arguments that need to be passed to the method.

You might consider using the Command pattern in the following scenarios:

Using the command pattern, you can store multiple commands in a class to use them over and over.
When you want to parametrize objects with operations.
When you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
When you want to implement deferred execution of operations.
When you want to implement audit and undo/redo.
When you want to assemble a set of simple operations into a complex one.
