  It is used to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable
  interchangeable(able to be exchanged with each other without making any difference)

 The strategy pattern allows the client to choose which algorithm to use at runtime,
 making it easy to change the algorithm used by the client without affecting the client itself.

 This pattern is often used to implement various optimization or
 calculation strategies in a flexible and maintainable way.
