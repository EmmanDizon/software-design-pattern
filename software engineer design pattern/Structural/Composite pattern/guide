We use this pattern in situations where we want to represent a hierarchy of objects
and treat them uniformly

The composite pattern is a design pattern in which objects are treated uniformly,
whether they are simple individual objects or complex structures made up of many individual objects.


"Treated in the same manner" means that objects are manipulated using the same methods, regardless of whether they are individual objects or compositions of objects.

In the context of the composite pattern, this means that both individual objects and compositions of objects are treated using the same set of methods defined in the common interface.
