allows us to create a proxy or agent for real object.
if we will talk to object, we will talk to its proxy (middleman)


This pattern is used when you need to add an additional layer of control over an object to limit or manage access to it.


In simpler terms, a proxy is a substitute object that provides a similar interface as the original object,
but with added functionalities such as access control, caching, or any other additional processing.
You use a proxy when you want to control access to an object or improve performance
by adding an additional layer of processing.
