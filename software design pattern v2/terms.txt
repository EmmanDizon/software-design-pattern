the aim of design patterns is to make software design or our code more understandable and maintainable


bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships
- linus torvalds


instantiated classes are used when you need to create objects with unique attributes and behaviors,
and when you want to take advantage of inheritance and polymorphism.
Static methods are used when you need to perform operations that are not tied to any particular object,
 and when you want to access class-level data or behavior.
 Both have their own use cases and can be beneficial depending on the requirements of your program.


inheritance vs composition:
 inheritance is unfortunately static, we cannot change the behaviors at run-time
 in several programming languages every class may have just a single parent class, this is why
 we should favor composition over inheritance
