What happens under the hood when we create a new objects in java.
Java manages two different areas of the memory, one is heap and the other one is stack.

1. Heap -> this is where it stores its objects
2. Stack -> stores short lived variables like all the primitive, as well as the variables that store references
to objects on the heap
